js86emu
=======

x86 emulator written in Javascript.

The plan is to emulate multiple x86 chips along with auxilary hardware such as
Harddisk controllers, BIOS and graphics.

Currently

*  41 instructions decoded and mostly working
*  Basic (non-segmented) memory
*  Basic debugging (gotta have this)

We'll see how far I get :)
